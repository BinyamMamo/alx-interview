# Prime Game üé≤

> Why don't prime numbers ever get invited to parties? Because they can't even!

## Description üìÑ

Maria and Ben are playing a game with a set of consecutive integers starting from `1` up to and including `n`. They take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number along with its multiples. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

This project simulates multiple rounds of this game and determines the overall winner.
