# 🗝️ 0x01. Lockboxes Project  🌟
Welcome to the **Lockboxes Project**! In this project, I dug into the world of locked boxes. What did I do? Well, I cracked open those boxes, one by one. 🕵️‍♀️🔓 And what did I learn? Oh, so much! I discovered the power of nested lists, had a eureka moment when I realized that sometimes the key to success is just a cleverly placed loop. 🤯🔑
